      <h1 class="testing animated wobble">GSBTB Open Art Shelter.</h1>

      <p class="testing2"> I should ask Hania and others at GSBTB how I can officially help fundraise for the Open Art Shelter activities. Perhaps I can set up a cinema fund, museum fund, brunch fund, etc.</p>
    </div> 

    <div>
      <h1 class="testing testing2">Bikeygees - Biking Lessons For (Refugee) Women and Teens.</h1>

      <p>Don't forget to reach out to Bikeygees and/or Rueckenwind and see if they can either use the bikes that I bought from the auction and/or are open to me fundraising for them while I am in the states. I should do this ASAP.</p>   

      <p>Contact NYC, LA and Upstate NY contacts about biking groups.</p>

      <h1>Playdates.</h1>

      <p>Ask the girls if I can also fundraise for them. Maybe I can fundraise for all three groups at once, or maybe it makes more sense to do different fundraising events/projects.</p>
